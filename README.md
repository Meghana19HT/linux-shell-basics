# Linux Shell Basics - Mini Project

This project contains a basic shell script written as part of my DevOps learning journey.

### What it does:
- Creates a directory
- Inside it, creates two files
- Demonstrates use of `chmod` and shebang (`#!/bin/bash`)

### Skills Practiced:
- Shell scripting
- Linux commands (`mkdir`, `touch`, `chmod`, etc.)
- Permissions and script execution
